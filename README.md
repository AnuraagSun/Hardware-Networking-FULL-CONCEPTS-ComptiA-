### Network Fundamentals

Network fundamentals is the first lesson, which covers basic network theory and terminology, providing a framework for understanding networking and its complexity.

### Prerequisites
The Network Plus exam assumes that candidates have around 18 months of experience in the industry, and it is recommended that they have some basic knowledge of computers and working knowledge of networks.

### Module Introduction
The module introduces networks, what makes up a network, and the terminology used to describe those objects, including breaking down technical jargon to understand what each object does and its functions in a network.

### Module Objectives
The module objectives include:
- Defining and describing a network and a computer network
- Describing the components of a network
- Defining the terms node and server
- Defining the network backbone and its variations

### Network Definition
A network is defined as an interconnected or interrelated chain, group, or system, generally based on a purpose, and a computer network is the interconnecting of two or more computers that have a basic core purpose of communicating electronically.

### Internet Overview
The internet is a large computer network, and whether a network is comprised of two computers or two million computers, there are commonalities and requirements, including devices, media, and network adapters, which enable devices to communicate with each other.

### Network Components

#### Devices
Devices, such as computers, printers, switches, and routers, are connected together by media, which can be physical, like copper or fiber optics, or wireless, like Wi-Fi or radio frequency.

#### Device Communication
Each device has its own language, and network adapters, also known as network interfaces, are used to allow devices to communicate with the rest of the network.

#### Network Adapter
A network adapter, also known as a controller or NIC, serves as a translator between devices and the media through which data is sent, and it is essential for managing and governing how devices communicate with each other.

#### Network Operating System
The network operating system is similar to a ring leader in a circus, telling the network how to work together efficiently, and it is responsible for:
- Allocating resources
- Monitoring device activities
- Managing files and data

### Node Types

#### Basic Nodes
A node is any device connected to a communications network, including:
- Clients
- Servers
- Printers
- Network-attached storage devices
All of these are considered endpoint nodes.

#### Redistribution Nodes
Redistribution nodes, such as:
- Routers
- Switches
- Hubs
Are responsible for passing data on to other nodes, either redistribution nodes or endpoint nodes.

### Server Definition
A server is a network device that:
- Shares resources
- Manages services like addressing
- Controls network-wide functions, including permissions
And it is a type of node.

### Network Backbone
The network backbone:
- Carries the majority of network traffic
- Works at very high speeds
- Connects smaller networks together
- Requires to be large, fast, and capable of communicating at high speeds

### Types of Network Backbones
There are four types of network backbones, including:
- Serial
- Hierarchical
- Distributed backbones

### Network Logical Topology

The logical topology of a network can be different from its physical topology, as seen in the example of a logical bus topology used with a physical star topology, where data is received by all nodes simultaneously despite the physical setup.

Network topology refers to the arrangement of a network, which can be either physical or logical, and it is essential for administrators to understand how the network is designed both physically and logically.

A logical ring topology is a type of network where data is transmitted between upstream and downstream neighbors in a specific order, and most ring networks are physical stars.

In a logical star topology, a central device is used to pull each node to see if it has data to be transmitted, and it ensures that each node has an opportunity to transmit while governing the transmission time and preventing data collisions.

Network topologies include bus, star, ring, tree, and mesh, and each has its unique characteristics, such as the need for terminators in a bus topology and the use of a central device in a star topology.

A hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies, and a common example is a physical star with a logical ring, which is important for administrators to understand.

## Network Hardware and Media - Bounded Media

### Introduction
The discussion of network topology is followed by an introduction to network hardware and media, which includes bounded network media such as copper media, coaxial cable, and fiber optic media.

# Data Transmission Methods and Media Access Techniques

## Data Transmission Overview
- **Definition**:
  - Data transmission is the process of transferring data between devices using binary data (bits, ones, and zeros).
  - It includes methods such as **instantaneous data transfer**, **serial transmission**, and **parallel transmission**.
- **Instantaneous Data Transfer**:
  - Sends data immediately without storing it.
  - Common in real-time applications like online chat, video conferencing, and voice conferencing.
  - Converts data into a network-compatible format for immediate transmission.

---

## Serial and Parallel Data Transmission
- **Serial Data Transmission**:
  - Sends one bit at a time.
  - Commonly used in Ethernet, peripheral devices (mice, keyboards), and other technologies.
  - **Two Types**:
    1. **Synchronous**:
       - Uses a clock chip to synchronize data transmission.
       - Ensures devices are in sync with standardized time intervals.
    2. **Asynchronous**:
       - Embeds start and stop bits into the data stream to maintain synchronization.
       - Does not require a clock chip.
  - **Error Checking**:
    - Includes methods for error detection and correction during transmission.
- **Parallel Data Transmission**:
  - Sends multiple bits simultaneously over multiple transmission lines.
  - Offers higher throughput compared to serial transmission.
  - Examples: SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), parallel ports, and PCMCIA.
  - **Key Characteristics**:
    - Transmits eight parallel bits as a "character."
    - Common in older devices; less widely used today.

## Baseband and Broadband Transmission
- **Baseband Transmission**:
  - Digital transmission using direct current (DC) pulses.
  - All devices share the same medium, and transmission is unidirectional.
  - **Digital Signals**:
    - Represent "on" and "off" states (ones and zeros).
    - Time slots may be assigned to determine when data is sent or received.
- **Broadband Transmission**:
  - Analog transmission using the full bandwidth of a medium.
  - Data travels unidirectionally.
  - **Broadband Over Power Lines (BPL)**:
    - Uses existing power lines to provide internet access.
    - Speeds range from 500 Kbps to 3 Mbps.
    - Raises concerns about electromagnetic interference and security.

## Media Access Methods
- **Definition**:
  - Media access rules govern how devices access the network medium and send data.
  - Two categories:
    1. **Contention-Based Media Access**:
       - Devices compete for access, leading to possible collisions and delays.
    2. **Controlled Media Access**:
       - Central device controls access, ensuring orderly communication.

### Contention-Based Media Access
- **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**:
  - Common in Ethernet networks.
  - **Process**:
    1. Device listens for network availability.
    2. If available, it transmits data.
    3. If a collision occurs, the device waits and retransmits.
  - Effective in wired networks but less efficient with high traffic.
- **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**:
  - Used in wireless networks.
  - **Process**:
    1. Device listens for network availability.
    2. If available, it sends a "jamming signal" to indicate transmission.
    3. After waiting, it transmits data.
    4. Monitors for collisions and retries if necessary.

### Controlled Media Access
- **Polling**:
  - Central device queries each node to check if it has data to send.
  - Ensures orderly transmission but can waste time querying idle devices.
- **Demand Priority**:
  - Nodes signal when they have data to transmit.
  - Prioritizes urgent data while preventing constant priority signaling.
- **Multiplexing**:
  - Combines multiple signals over a single medium.
  - Two types:
    1. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**:
       - Divides channels into time slots for dedicated access.
    2. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**:
       - Assigns different frequencies to nodes for simultaneous data transfer.

## Contention and Broadcast Domains
- **Contention Domain**:
  - Area where devices compete for media access.
  - Collisions may occur, making it a "collision domain."
  - Switches can reduce contention by segmenting networks.
- **Broadcast Domain**:
  - Logical area where all devices can receive broadcast messages.
  - Routers separate broadcast domains to manage traffic.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- **Data Transmission Types**:
  - Serial (synchronous and asynchronous) and parallel.
  - Baseband (digital) and broadband (analog).
- **Media Access Methods**:
  - Contention-based (CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA).
  - Controlled access (polling, demand priority, multiplexing).
